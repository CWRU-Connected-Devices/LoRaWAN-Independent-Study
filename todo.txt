Ideal final product

1) clean code base
2) list of dependencies to install
3) markdown code to document install process
4) interfacing with sensor
5) 


repo organization:
code base / solution set


todo
1) encode/decode serialization
2) figuring out why lmic is pending

RXTXPEND is an operation mode of the MAC specifying that there is a tx/rx pending.

DEFINE_LMIC is a weird preprocessor tag that expands to creating a struct called lmic_t
LMIC object is a struct defined by some weird preprocessor black magic.
LMIC struct holds pointers to all the different jobs, client data, radio communication timing, etc.
opmode holds the flags left from the engineUpdate() method.

I could look into setting the LMIC debug level to 1
- I tried setting the compiler flag but nothing was being outputted

look into: sendBuffer.cpp lmic callback

3) document solution space
4) change topic
5) redo lambda
6) Go back and create student version of above, walk through assignment
